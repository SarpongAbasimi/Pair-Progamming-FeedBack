|----|--------------------|----------------------------------|
|One |    **[Xain](https://github.com/Xa1n)** |Sarpong was really open and communicative about his thoughts, and made sure I understood what he was thinking about before we moved on. If there was something I didn't understand, he sat and explained it until I did, and if he didn't understand it himself, gave us both time to research it and discuss it so we could come to a consensus. He was also great at motivating us both as we completed the various tasks during the challenges.|
|One| **[Yadira](https://github.com/yadlra)**| Sarpong was an incredible pair to work with. He is very knowledgable. His knowledge allowed me to get a better insight into things I did not fully understand. I very much appreciate his help in explaining with detail why things work the way they work and allowing me to explain back to him.|
|Two|**[Max](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear)** |Unsatisfied with simply knowing *how* to do things, Sarpongâ€™s intrigue for  *why* a method might work a particular way helped spark enlightening conversations.Sarpong is an effective communicator and is good at giving examples of code implementations to help contextualise his arguments. Fantastic team player and thoroughly enjoyed his energy.|
|Two|**[Callum](https://github.com/callum-marshall)**|I think we made good progress today. I liked that we discussed the direction of the code, and you encouraged me to have input and then test it. I liked that we read about things we were unsure about. I really appreciated your patience in letting me figure things out for myself when I didn't understand things and I feel like I learnt/solidified a few concepts in the session. Really productive afternoon :+1: |
