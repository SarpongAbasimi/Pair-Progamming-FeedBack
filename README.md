|    Xain            |          Sarpong was really open and communicative about his thoughts, and made sure I understood what he was thinking about before we moved on. If there was something I didn't understand, he sat and explained it until I did, and if he didn't understand it himself, gave us both time to research it and discuss it so we could come to a consensus. He was also great at motivating us both as we completed the various tasks during the challenges.                        |
