## Pair Feed Back
|Week|    Name            |   Pair FeedBack                  |
|----|--------------------|----------------------------------|
|One |    **[Xain](https://github.com/Xa1n)** |Sarpong was really open and communicative about his thoughts, and made sure I understood what he was thinking about before we moved on. If there was something I didn't understand, he sat and explained it until I did, and if he didn't understand it himself, gave us both time to research it and discuss it so we could come to a consensus. He was also great at motivating us both as we completed the various tasks during the challenges.|
|One| **[Yadira](https://github.com/yadlra)**| Sarpong was an incredible pair to work with. He is very knowledgable. His knowledge allowed me to get a better insight into things I did not fully understand. I very much appreciate his help in explaining with detail why things work the way they work and allowing me to explain back to him.|
|Two|**[Max](https://github.com/MaxRobertsDear)** |Unsatisfied with simply knowing *how* to do things, Sarpong’s intrigue for  *why* a method might work a particular way helped spark enlightening conversations.Sarpong is an effective communicator and is good at giving examples of code implementations to help contextualise his arguments. Fantastic team player and thoroughly enjoyed his energy.|
|Two|**[Callum](https://github.com/callum-marshall)**|I think we made good progress today. I liked that we discussed the direction of the code, and you encouraged me to have input and then test it. I liked that we read about things we were unsure about. I really appreciated your patience in letting me figure things out for myself when I didn't understand things and I feel like I learnt/solidified a few concepts in the session. Really productive afternoon :+1: |
|Two| **[Scott](https://github.com/HottScall)** |I paired with Sarpong on the Oyster Card challenge whilst at Makers. I found Sarpong to be a great teacher, at the time I was struggling to understand how to break down certain problems and issues within the challenge and Sarpong took time out of the project and his time to slowly work through a number of exersizes to get me up to speed. He went through everything with me at my pace which would typically be a lot slower than how Sarpong would work, which I really appreciated. He also gave me some very worthwhile feedback at the end of our session which I have taken on board. His honesty and detailed feedback has helped me to understand my weak points and where I need to improve. I’m grateful to have worked with Sarpong at this early stage of the course as it’s allowed me to refocus some of my short term goals whilst here at Makers.|
|Two| **[Jake](https://github.com/NapperJLG)**|I thought it was a really good session. You're a fun guy to work with and you clearly have a good grasp of the fundamentals of coding, which I am still a bit shaky with from time to time! You were also very patient with me while I described things terribly so I appreciate that as well :sweat_smile: I'd defo be happy to be pairing with you again!|
|Three| **[Sejin](https://github.com/sejinkay)**|Thank you again for the good session, you were so energetic and I learned a lot that day // Sarpong is a great pair-partner and teacher, who approaches the problem methodically. When we face a big problem, he knows how to break them down and doesn't get overwhelmed by it. I like the fact that even though he already understands certain concepts, if his partner is struggling with it, he makes his own examples to help/explain and make it sure that person understand it as well and progress/learn together. I was impressed by rather than just leaving the project unfinished, how he tries to push it further to polish his projects. I enjoyed working together with Sarpong, it was a motivating session.|
|Four| **[Calum](https://github.com/CalumDarroch)**|Very good pairing session IMO, I really appreciated you taking the time to explain things and walk me through step-by-step. Your explanations were clear and helped a lot. I hope you got something out of it as well!|
|Five| **[Mike](https://github.com/Michael-Darmody)** |Hi Sarpong, overall I thought we had a great session yesterday! Being completely new to Js, I thought we worked through the challenges very methodically, researching topics we were unsure about and making sure we were trying our own examples and not relying too heavily on the walkthrough. You were also great at helping me with syntax and explaining what certain parts of the code did (I.E function). I feel like I learnt a lot yesterday and it was a great introduction to Js, cheers|
